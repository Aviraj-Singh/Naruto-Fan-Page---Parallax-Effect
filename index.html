            <p class="text">
                Naruto, a name that’ll attract instant attraction from anyone in the anime community. It is an amazing show that ran from 2002 all the way to 2017. I love and adore this show as one of my favorite because of several reasons. It offers great fights, an amazing power system, and, most of all, very well-written characters. Naruto is a show greatly carried by the quality and philosophies of the characters within. The life lessons from Naruto and the bone-chilling ‘Wake up to Reality’ speech by Madara Uchiha are still engraved in the minds of every watcher.
                <br> <br>
                In short, the story starts with orphan Naruto Uzumaki, who pulls annoying pranks on the villagers. Naruto dreams of becoming Hokage, the highest-ranking authority in the village, and chases recklessly after that dream. The journey is filled with emotional ups and downs, heart-wrenching losses, and triumphs of the human spirit. The story ultimately concludes with Naruto fulfilling his dream and becoming the Hokage, inspiring future generations and solidifying his place in the hearts of fans everywhere. Though all the characters are best, I feel the below mentioned ten characters in Naruto leave their own unique mark and teachings on the series, serving as important figures in Naruto's journey and providing valuable lessons for viewers.
                <br> <br>
                Well it is to be noted that I will keep on adding the characters and their teachings meanwhile. So be patient :-)
